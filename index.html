			    <h2 class="heading">Why use a Framework</h2>
				<p class="lead">When approaching RPA in an enterprise environment, there is a lot to consider. As a team, we are attempting to hit a moving target in regards to creating an effective system that many developers can be creative in, allowing them to solve problems. As well, we have a need to manage these processes as they transition through different environments, namely the Development (Dev) and Production (Prod) environments. 
				A framework is designed to help in the management of these processes, as well as the development of these processes. It is designed to give the developer a canvas which isnâ€™t completely blank, but has some features which will be necessary to navigate the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in changing environments. 
				Some of the processes needed to move to production are removed, or alleviated from the developer by utilizing the framework. 
				Where do I house my share-drive dependencies? 
				How do I connect to CyberArk?
				How do I create an XML, or read from that file?
				Where should all of these things go so that they follow a pattern? 
				How do I implement flow control and logging?
				These are just a few of the problems solved by the framework, and deployed to each developer.</p>
